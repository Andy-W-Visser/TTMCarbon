These MATLAB programes illustrate the use of the transpoty matrix OCIM in estimating the residence times of injected carbon onto the ocean interior. 
The matrix itself is has been developed by Tim deVries at the University of Sanata Barbra aand can be downloaded at

Within the code, the TMM is imported as load('CTL.mat')

PassageTimes : calculates the first and las passage time from and to the sea floor.
